# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis

## Introduction
This project analyzes sales data from Maven Roasters, a fictional coffee shop chain operating in three New York City locations. The analysis aims to uncover sales trends, identify top-performing products, and provide insights to optimize business operations.

## Data Description
The dataset contains transaction records with the following information:
- Transaction details (ID, date, time, quantity)
- Store information (ID, location)
- Product information (ID, price, category, type, detail)

The data covers multiple months of sales across three NYC locations.

## Tools Used
